The bridge of Plaka is a famous example of traditional architecture and engineering in north-west Greece. It collapsed a few years ago after a great flood. Shortly afterwards the National Technical University of Athens started an extensive program of reconstrucion.

This book presents the entire research and final proposal for the reconstruction. It is very interesting in the sense that it presents a the whole range of disciplines that need to collaborate for such a projects, from historians to architects, civil engineers and specialists in construction materials. As a design it was challenging in the sense that it is a technical book addressed mostly to engineers. In our design we have focued on practicality, on presenting effectively the huge ammount of information that the book contains.
