The publication (In)formal Urbanism presents the results of a workshop co-organized by the National Technical University of Athens, the TU Dortmund and the Goethe-Institut in Athens. It contains both essays and design proposals focused on the Acharnes area in Athens and Dortmund Nordstadt.

Our work was to design the publication from the first concept until its printing. The goal was to create an original design but relate it to previous publications of the same series.
